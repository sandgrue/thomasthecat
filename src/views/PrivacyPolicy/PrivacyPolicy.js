                                        <p>We also gather information about how visitors navigate through our site by
                                            using clickstream data from 'cookies' or other online tools. A 'cookie' is a
                                            small data file that is stored by your Web browser on your computer. Most
                                            cookies are 'session cookies', meaning that they are automatically deleted from
                                            your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our
                                            cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use
                                            of some of our site or services. You may also encounter cookies from third

                                        <p>We will maintain the data that you provide us, along with a record of your
                                            site visits, in a secure database and use your information only as permitted by
                                            law. To best serve you, we may combine this information with data that is
                                            publicly available and data that we receive from other reliable sources whose
                                            policies meet the Direct Marketing Association's privacy standards. If you
                                            request specific products or services, we will transfer your listing contact
                                            information as required by vendors, companies, affiliates, and partners, unless

                                        <p>Credit card information collected provides our members with the convenience
                                            of purchasing our products and services online. Credit card information is
                                            defined as any information that appears on a page where a credit card number
                                            can be submitted. All credit card information is protected by SSL encryption
                                            technology. Once submitted, your credit card information is not stored on our
                                            server. Your credit card information will not be distributed unless we have
                                            your permission to do so or unless required by law.</p>

                                        <p>We don't sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their
                                            marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your
                                            information with information we collect from other companies and use it to
                                            improve and personalize our services, content and advertising. We may use or
                                            provide affiliates or partners with aggregate information from the information
                                            obtained from all users, and the aggregate information cannot be used to
                                            contact you. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any affiliates' or partners'
                                            use of such information, and we are not responsible for the privacy policy or
                                            content of our affiliates' or partners' Websites.</p>

                                        <p>Because email is used to provide certain notifications and services,

                                            notifications and services via telephone and therefore must consent to receive
                                            calls from the Renter's Hotline. You hereby consent to any such communication

                                        <p>We may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements,

                                            violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or

                                            treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools
                                            (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal
                                            information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you
                                            probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions
                                            or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal
