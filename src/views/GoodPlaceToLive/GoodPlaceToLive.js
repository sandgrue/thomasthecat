                                    Subsidized housing programs don.t mean .sub. par housing. Rental Housing Deals gives you the tools to make the right decision about the best place to call home while making the whole process simple. Every housing assistance program requires that a unit be in .safe, decent and sanitary. condition. This means that there are standard requirements for each room of a unit. To help you understand the requirements, HUD.s .A Good Place to Live Brochure. takes you through each room of a unit to show you the things you need to look for and beware of in that space. Also, RHD has listed the Top 25 Deficiencies that you need to look over so that you can make sure that your new place is in the best condition possible.
