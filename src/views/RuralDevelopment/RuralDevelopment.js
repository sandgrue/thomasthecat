                                    HUD offers the Public Housing (PH), Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) and Affordable Housing/Low Income Housing Tax Credit (AH/LIHTC) programs. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) only has one program known as Rental Assistance. This program is administered in rural areas of the country. Rental assistance (RA) is not located in metropolitan cities. Generally, these are communities of fewer than 10,000 persons except that certain communities between 10,000 and 25,000 population are considered rural based on their distance from urban areas.

                                    The USDA/RD program provides funding to communities. The funding will cover the entire property meaning every unit will receive rental assistance or it can only cover a certain number of units in the community. Even if Rental assistance (RA) is not given to each unit, the rents for the property are significantly lower than the rents in the surrounding area.
