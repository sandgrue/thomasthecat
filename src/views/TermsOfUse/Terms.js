                                <p>B. EXPIRATION AND RENEWALS OF PROPERTY LISTING</p>

                                <p>The Premium Listing Plan is active from the date the property listing is placed for a period of twelve months. Managers wishing to renew the Premium Plan may do so by purchasing a twelve-month renewal for $399. Managers will be notified via email approximately 10 business days prior to the expiration date with a reminder that their property listing is about to expire and will have 72 hours to notify RentalHousingDeals.com not to renew their property listing before the listing plan is automatically renewed. This is the only means by which we will contact Manager regarding the expiration and renewal of the property listing. If Manager does not receive an email from RentalHousingDeals.com, then it is Manager's responsibility to notify RentalHousingDeals.com not to renew the property listing.</p>

                                <p>C. REMOVAL AND CANCELLATION OF PROPERTY LISTING</p>

                                <p>Manager is responsible for and should request removal of the property listing from the "Edit Listing" page of the Manager's "My home" page of the RentalHousingDeals.com by calling customer service at (626) 281-8300. Manager will receive a confirmation email and must respond within 72 hours to confirm the requested cancellation or listing removal. Cancellation or removal of the property listing does not cancel, remove or deactivate user account information.</p>

                                <p>D. PRICES AND AVAILABILITY MAY VARY</p>

                                <p>The prices quoted in these Terms are the same regardless of whether ordered online or by calling by phone. In addition, plan prices may vary depending on specials, discounts or rebates that may be in effect from time to time. None of the prices set forth herein are contingent upon the rental of the Manager's property, or any other real estate transaction</p>

Manager is not purchasing a listing with these other third-party Websites as part of the payment you pay to RentalHousingDeals.com. The submission of your property listing information to these other third-party Websites is a part of the Services provided when Manager registers as a RentalHousingDeals.com Manager. If the listing is rejected for any reason by a third-party Website and therefore fails to be included in a third-party Website, Manager has no recourse against RentalHousingDeals.com. If Manager objects to any changes to the listing feeds or the list of other third-party Websites to which we submit the property listing information, Manager's sole and exclusive recourse shall be to cease using the Services.

Manager agrees and acknowledges that RentalHousingDeals.com shall have no liability at all concerning claims related to the submission of the property listing information to or the use, display or modification or removal of the property listing information on or by or from third-party Websites. Manager's sole and exclusive remedy for such claims shall be to cease using the Services.</p>
